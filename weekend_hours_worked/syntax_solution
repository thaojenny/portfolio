--requirement: Return a list of employee ids and weekend hours worked, descending by hours worked

--create a table which includes emp_id and hours worked of each date and emp_id
with table1 as (
select emp_id,
		case when extract(minute from time_stamp ::timestamp) >= extract(minute from lag(time_stamp ::timestamp) over (partition by cast(time_stamp as date), emp_id order by time_stamp :: timestamp))
				   then extract(hour from time_stamp ::timestamp)- extract(hour from lag(time_stamp :: timestamp) over (partition by cast(time_stamp as date), emp_id order by time_stamp :: timestamp))
		else extract(hour from time_stamp ::timestamp)- extract(hour from lag(time_stamp :: timestamp) over (partition by cast(time_stamp as date), emp_id order by time_stamp :: timestamp)) -1
		 end as hours
from attendance)

-- calculate total number of hours worked by each distinct employee id from above table created
select emp_id, sum(hours) as total_hours_worked
from table1
group by emp_id
order by total_hours_worked desc;
